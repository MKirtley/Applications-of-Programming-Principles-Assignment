# Applications-of-Programming-Principles
This is the assignment for the my first year's Applications of Programming Principles unit.
In this unit I achieved a First (83/100).


This unit was for me to achieve the following - 

- Design and implement solutions to complex problems using multiple software languages.
- Demonstrate an understanding of the importance of developing software in an ethical, secure, and professional manner.
- Develop graphical interfaces which manipulate data.
- Develop software that adheres to current industry standards.


My task was to style and build a web app that consists of:

1. A front-end web-page. This is to be a single page app made with HTML (provided),
CSS and JavaScript that communicates with a back-end API to load and process user
data. It should:
  - Display a list of users (including paging).
  - Display a single user (selected from the user list).
  - Enable a new user to be created.
  - Enable a user to be updated.
  - Enables a user to be deleted.
  - Use AJAX with JSON to communicate with the back-end API.
  
2. A back-end API that supports the front-end functionality. The test endpoints that you 
will need to use are:
  - GET LIST USERS.
  - GET SINGLE USER.
  - POST CREATE.
  - PUT UPDATE.
  - DELETE DELETE.

Styling
You will be provided with a plain HTML version of the user web page. You should use CSS to
style the page according to the PARC guidelines (see the POP Ethical Design Principles
lecture). Preferably use a CSS framework such as W3.CSS or bootstrap.
